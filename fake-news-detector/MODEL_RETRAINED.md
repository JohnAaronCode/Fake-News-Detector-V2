# 🎯 MODEL RETRAINED - ACCURACY FIXED!

## ✅ Problem Solved!

### The Issue
Your model was saying everything is "REAL" because it only had **6 training examples** - way too small to learn patterns!

### The Solution
✅ **Retrained with 45 examples:**
- 20 Real news examples
- 25 Fake news examples
- Better variety of patterns
- More realistic examples

---

## 🔄 What Was Changed

### 1. Enhanced Training Data

**Before (6 examples):**
```python
"The government announced a new policy to support farmers."  # Real
"Aliens have landed on Earth..."  # Fake
# ... only 4 more examples
```

**After (45 examples):**
- Real news about: government, economy, courts, research, health, etc.
- Fake news about: aliens, conspiracies, miracle cures, clickbait, etc.

### 2. Better Pattern Recognition

The model now recognizes:
- **Real news patterns:** Official announcements, verifiable facts, proper sources
- **Fake news patterns:** Sensationalism, conspiracies, miracle claims, clickbait

## 💡 Understanding the Results

### Confidence Scores
- **0.90 - 1.00** = Very confident
- **0.70 - 0.89** = Confident
- **0.50 - 0.69** = Moderately confident
- **Below 0.50** = Uncertain (consider as opposite)

### Why It's Not Perfect
- ✅ Better than before (45 vs 6 examples)
- ⚠️ Still limited training data
- ⚠️ Real-world datasets have thousands/millions of examples
- ⚠️ May struggle with nuanced or ambiguous content

### How to Improve Further
1. Add more training examples (100+, 1000+ better)
2. Use real datasets (Kaggle has fake news datasets)
3. Try different models (Random Forest, Neural Networks)
4. Add more features (source credibility, grammar analysis)
