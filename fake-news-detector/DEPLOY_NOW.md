# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist - COMPLETED!

- ✅ Python environment configured (Python 3.12.5)
- ✅ All dependencies installed locally
- ✅ Flask backend tested locally on http://localhost:5000
- ✅ Frontend tested locally
- ✅ Vercel CLI installed (v48.6.0)
- ✅ Project structure optimized for Vercel
- ✅ All configuration files ready

## 📦 Your Project is Ready to Deploy!

### Step 1: Login to Vercel
Run this command in your terminal:
```powershell
vercel login
```

This will:
1. Open your browser
2. Ask you to log in to Vercel (or create an account)
3. Authenticate your CLI

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
After logging in, run:
```powershell
vercel
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions:
- **Set up and deploy?** → Yes
- **Which scope?** → Select your account
- **Link to existing project?** → No (first time)
- **Project name?** → Press Enter (uses folder name) or type a custom name
- **Directory?** → Press Enter (uses current directory)
- **Override settings?** → No

### Step 3: Deploy to Production
After the first deployment succeeds, deploy to production:
```powershell
vercel --prod
```

## 🌐 Your Deployed URLs
After deployment, you'll get:
- **Preview URL**: `https://your-project-name-hash.vercel.app`
- **Production URL**: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## 📋 Important Files (Already Configured)

### ✅ vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "api/index.py"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/$1"
    }
  ],
  "outputDirectory": "frontend"
}
```

### ✅ API Endpoints
- `/api/health` - Health check
- `/api/analyze` - Analyze news text
- `/api/train` - Retrain model

### ✅ Frontend
- Auto-detects production vs localhost
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all files are committed to git
3. Check that `.pkl` files are in `/api` directory
4. Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

### If API doesn't work:
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify Python version compatibility
3. Check environment variables if needed

### If frontend doesn't load:
1. Verify routing in `vercel.json`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API endpoint URL in `script.js`
